               the interpretation and geometry generation into thousands of
               threads running in parallel. We introduce a highly parallel
               algorithm for L-system evaluation that works on arbitrary
               L-systems, including parametric productions, context
               sensitive productions, stochastic production selection, and
               productions with side effects. Further we directly interpret
               the productions defined in plain-text, without requiring any
               compilation or transformation step (e.g., into shaders). Our
               algorithm is efficient in the sense that it requires no
               explicit inter-thread communication or atomic operations,
               and is thus completely lock free.",
